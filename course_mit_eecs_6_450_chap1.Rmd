# 1.Introduction

-   Source Encoder and Channel Encoder

why this?
	

```
**Shannon's Channel Separation Theorem**
```

## 1.1 Standardized Interfaces And Layering

## 1.2 Communucation sources

-   The study before 1948 was based on Fourier analysis - Nyquist theory
-   Chapter 2
    source entrophy is equal to the minimum number of  binary digits per source symbol required to map the source output into binary digits in such a way that the source symbols may be retrieved from the encoded sequence.

data compression

-   Chapter 3  quantization
-   Chapter 4  sampling, the signal space approach

## 1.3 Communication channels

Chapter 7 Random processes

Chapter 9 Randomly varying channels

Chapter 6 modulation and demodulation

Chapter 8 detection

-   channel coding theorem

more sophisticated coding schemes can achieve arbitrarily low error probability at any data rate above a value known as the channel capacity.
