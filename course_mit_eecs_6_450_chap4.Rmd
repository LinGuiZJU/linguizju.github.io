# 4. Source and channel waveforms

## 4.1 Introduction

-   A modulator, is to convert the incoming sequence of binary digits into a waveform in such a way that the noise-corrupted waveform at the receiver can, with high probability, be converted back into the original binary digits. 

## 4.2 Fourier series

Our interest here is almost exclusively in time-limited rather than periodic wave-forms.

    \intsym{T/2}\abs{u(t)-v(t)}^2\d t=T\sumsub{k}{}|\hat u_k-\hat v_k|^2
    $$
    The energy in the waveform difference is a common and reasonable measure of distortion.

    >   ??? When a finite-energy baseband waveform is modulated by that sinusoid up to passband, the resulting passband waveform has finite energy.

## 4.3  $L_2$ functions and Lebesgue integration over

The Lebesgue approximation splits the vertical axis into uniform segments and sums the height times width measure for each segment.

-   *measure*

    *outer measure*  is essentially the measure of the smalles cover of A(countable union of intervals)
          $$
          	\mu^o(A)=\inf_{B:B \text { covers }A}\mu(B)
          $$
    *measurable*

    >   >   $$
    >   >
    >   >   then
    >   >
    >   >   if measurable, then its measure is the outer measure

      The collection of measurable sets is closed under countable unions, contable intersections, and complementation.

    >   \int u(t)\d t=\liminf n \sumsub{m=0}{\infty}m2^{-n}\mu{m,n},\text{where  }\mu{m,n}=\mu(t:m2^{-n}\leq u(t)< (m+1)2^{-n})
    >   $$

    sets of zero measure can be ignored in integration

$$
	\int u(t)\d t=\int v(t) \d t, u(t) =v(t)\,a.s.

## 4.4 Fourier series for  waveforms

>   >   $$
>   >   Conversely, if $\sumsub{k=-\infty}{\infty}\abs{\hat u(k)}^2<\infty$, then $L_2,u(t)$ exists satisfied above two

Thus (4.19) asserts that  $u(t)$ can be approximated arbitrarily closely (in terms of difference energy) by finitely many terms in its Fourier series.

-   the sum doesn't converge pointwise to  $u(t)$ at each t

**particularly when discussing sampling and vector spaces, the concept of equivalence classes becomes relevant**

## 4.5 Fourier transforms and  waveforms

-   Energy equation 

$$
\intinf \intfun u {v^*} t=\intinf\intfun {\hat u}{\hat v^*} f\\
\intinf \abs {u(t)}^2\d t=\intinf \abs{\hat u(f)}^2\d f
$$

*Spectral Density*

-   *measurable*

$$
\mu(A)=\liminf T \mu(A\cap[-T/2,T/2])
$$

function measurable

iff $u(t)\rect (t/T)$ is measurable for all T>0

**two approaches to its Lebesgue integral**

-   use the definition formula
-   $\liminf T\intsym{T/2}u\d t$

-   $\sinc(t)$

**It is an example where the Riemman integral exists but the Lebesgue integral does not. **

**One can always use Lebesgue integration over [-A, A] and go to the limit , getting the same answer as the Riemmann integral provides.**

-   >   $L_1$, then 

>   -   $\hat u(f)=\intinf u(t)\etpin {ft}\d t$ exists 
>   -   satisfies  $\abs{\hat u(f)}\leq \int\abs{u(t)}\d t$
>   -   $\hat u(f)$ is a continuous function of $f$
>   -   also applies to inverse transforms



For $L_2$, The pointwise Fourier transform does not necessarily exist at each f, but that it does exist an  limit. However, the inverse transform exists in exactly the same sense.

>   $$
>   \hat u_A(f)=\intsym Au(t)\etpin {ft}\d t
>   $$
>
>   $L_2$, then $\hat u(f)$ exists satisfying 
>
>   -   $\liminf A\intinf\abs{\hat u(f)-\hat u_A(f)}^2\d f$
>   -   the energy equation

This not only guarantees the existence of a Fourier transform (up to  -equivalence), but also guarantees that it is arbitrarily closely approximated (in difference energy) by the continuous Fourier transforms of the truncated versions of  .

>   $$
>   u_B(t)=\intsym B \hat u(f)\etpi {ft} \d f
>   $$
>
>   $L_2$, $\hat u(f)$ is the Fourier transform above, then
>
>   -   $\liminf B\intinf \abs{u(t)-u_B(t)}^2\d t=0$

Specifically the inverse transforms of finite frequency truncations of the transform are continuous and converge to an $L_2$ limit as $B\rightarrow \infty$ 
$$
\hat u(f)=\text{l.i.m.}_{A\rightarrow \infty}\intsym A u(t)\etpin {ft}\d t\\
u(t)=\text{l.i.m.}_{B\rightarrow \infty}\intsym B\hat u(f)\etpi {ft}\d f
$$
The first integral above converges pointwise $u(t)$ if   is also  $L_1$, and in this case converges pointwise to a **continuous** function $\hat u(f)$. 

-   all the Fourier tranform relations **Except** differentiation hold for all  $L_2$ functions.

## 4.6 The DTFT and the sampling theorem

## 4.8 Summary

-   encoding souce waveforms
-   expand the waveform into an orthogonal expansion
-   quantize the coefficients in that expansion
-   use discrete source coding on the quantizer output
-   encodign waveforms to be transmitted over channels
-   map the incoming sequence of binary digits into a sequence of real or complex symbols
-   use the symbols as coefficients in an orthogonal expansion
-   These powerful  become important both when the waveforms are sample functions of random processes and when one wants to find limits on possible performance. In both of these situations, one is dealing with a large class of potential waveforms, rather than a single waveform, and these general results become important.
